# Tree-based-Arithmetic-Systems in Python

###Arithmetic Systems Using Trees Instead of Bit-strings. Scale up to computations with very large, super-exponential numbers.

This is a Python version of Haskell-based code, described in full detail in the two PADL'16 papers in folder "doc".

Numbers are represented as binary trees with empty leaves, using a simple, Python-tuples based tree representation.
